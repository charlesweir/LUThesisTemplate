Lancaster University Thesis Template

This is a version of the thesis template created by Kayla Friedman and Malcolm Morgan - see https://neuraldischarge.wordpress.com/2013/11/05/the-only-phdmasters-thesis-template-for-word-you-will-ever-need/ . See that page for instructions and background; it also has a good PowerPoint presentation by Malcolm Morgan on using Word for thesis writing.

I have made the following changes for Lancaster University use:
* Changed filenames
* Changed font styling (Lancaster makes less use of small caps)
* Put in Logo according to LU brand guidelines; removed college etc.
* Made line spacing double.
* Changed declaration to include papers written.

Click on Github's Download Zip button above to download an archive of these files:
* LAN Thesis Sample.docx - An example simple word document thesis.
* LAN Thesis Template.dotx - A Template to act as a basis for document. It fills in many of the fields correctly.
* LAN+Template.thmx - A PowerPoint theme for embedded pictures with black backgrounds... 


Word is not very good at handling very large files, so for a practical thesis you may need a master document with sub-documents for each chapter. That works fine with this template. See http://www.howtogeek.com/73960/create-a-master-document-in-word-2010-from-multiple-documents/ for instructions. Note that Mendeley and the various tables of contents support master documents as well.

You can find examples of successful theses from your department following the instructions here: http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/resources/theses-and-dissertations/ . Look for ones with Online Access, as you can get these easily.
