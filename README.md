#Thesis Template

This is a version of the thesis template created by Kayla Friedman and Malcolm Morgan - see https://neuraldischarge.wordpress.com/2013/11/05/the-only-phdmasters-thesis-template-for-word-you-will-ever-need/

I have made the following changes for Lancaster use:
* Changed filenames
* Changed fonts (Lancaster makes less use of small caps)
* Put in Logo; removed college etc.
* Made line spacing double.
* Changed declaration to include papers written.
