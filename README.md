# Lancaster University Thesis Template

Download the latest version here: [LUThesisTemplate.zip](https://github.com/charlesweir/LUThesisTemplate/releases/latest/download/LUThesisTemplate.zip)

This is a version of the [thesis template created by Kayla Friedman and Malcolm Morgan](https://neuraldischarge.wordpress.com/2013/11/05/the-only-phdmasters-thesis-template-for-word-you-will-ever-need/). See that page for instructions and background; it also has a good PowerPoint presentation by Malcolm Morgan on using Word for thesis writing.

This is a template. Using the Word styles it defines makes it easy to make changes throughout the document. Itâ€™s quite possible that your department may have different rules about style, content and formatting than the default here. If so, just change the styles accordingly.

We have made the following changes for Lancaster University use:

 - Changed filenames
 - Changed font styling (Lancaster makes less use of small caps)
 - Put in Logo according to LU brand guidelines; removed college etc.
 - Changed declaration to include papers written.
 - Fixed some traits that caused problems using it.
 - Added advice on master documents, image placing, and document updating.

* **LAN Thesis Sample.docx** - An example simple thesis.
* **LAN Thesis Template.dotx** - A Template to act as a basis for your thesis. It provides Lancaster University styling, all the appropriate tables of contents and similar, and gives examples of embedded images and tables..

There is also a Word plug-in [available here](https://github.com/charlesweir/WordImagesAndTables) that you may find helpful for adding and laying out images and tables.

Details on how to submit your thesis are available from the [Lancaster Library site here](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/how-to/theses/deposit-your-thesis/) .  The [Manual of Academic Regulations and Procedures](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/academic-standards-and-quality/marp/) gives word counts and detailed submission requirements.

Word is not good at handling very large files, so for a practical thesis you may need a master document with sub-documents for each chapter. That works fine with this template. See [this HowToGeek site](http://www.howtogeek.com/73960/create-a-master-document-in-word-2010-from-multiple-documents/) for instructions - the instructions are for an old version of Word, but still work well. Note that Mendeley and the various tables of contents support master documents as well.

You can find examples of successful theses from your department following the instructions on the [Lancaster Library site here](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/resources/theses-and-dissertations/). Look for ones with Online Access, as you can get these easily.

We're delighted to be able to help you with this one aspect of creating your thesis. Good luck!
